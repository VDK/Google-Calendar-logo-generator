Google-Calendar-logo-generator
==============================

Generates an SVG file that adjusts the Google Calendar logo to show the day of the month, instead of just 31

See it live at http://veradekok.nl/New%20Tab%20progsels/day.php

Created to be used with the Chrome extension Speed Dial 2 ( http://speeddial2.com/ ) 

Instead of picking the standard Google Calendar logo for the shortcut to your calendar, insert a link to the PHP file.

The PHP file has to be hosted on a server of course.

Enjoy.
